Iraq Blames Market Blast on Coalition	O O O O O O

They are , we are told , well trained .	U-PER O O U-ORG O O O O O O
This is a messy business .	O O O O O O
There ' s nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat , because it is to kill people .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O

And , all of a sudden , bang , it just hit me .	O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O

And it ' s removed .	O O O O O O
It ' s far off .	O O O O O O

And I went to the priest , because it bothered me .	O U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O

Of all the wounds time does not heal , the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
It ' s not something that civilized people do .	O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O
You don ' t - - it ' s just not - - it ' s not a matter of being tormented , but troubled in the sense that that ' s not what we do , unless we ' re called upon to do it , under the most extreme set of circumstances .

War may sometimes be a necessary thing , but it can never be a natural thing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Training bridges that gap .	O O O O O
Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam .	B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O U-GPE O
You are trying to kill people , because the alternative is , if you are in combat , you will be killed .	U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O
So your choices are not varied .	O U-PER O O O O O
It ' s very simple .	O O O O O O
And so you do what you ' re trained to do .	O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O
You do what you ' re there to do .	U-PER O O U-PER O O U-GPE O O O
And , in Vietnam , it was body count .	O O O U-GPE O O O O O O
Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you , going the other way .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O U-PER O O O O O O
It ' s hard to explain what training can do .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment , but to training .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You really don ' t have time to think : I ' m going the wrong way .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O
I should be going the other way .	U-PER O O O O O O O
Later , when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea , Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men , fighting their way to safety .	O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O U-GPE O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O O
He won a Bronze Star .	U-PER O O O O O
If you ' re killing people , it ' s out of fear , not really , in my opinion , out of bravery .	O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
Nobody is looking for medals .	U-PER O O O O O
Everyone wants to live another day .	U-PER O O O O O O

Rangel , Cunningham , Ridge and Hagel are all proud , decorated combat veterans .	U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
It ' s just , a decade later , killing still troubles the soul .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Hello Chris .	O U-PER O
Hi , Judy .	O O U-PER O
That ' s right .	O O O O O
Four U . S . soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division manning a checkpoint near the town of Najaf killed today in an apparent suicide bombing .	B-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|L-ORG I-PER I-PER|B-FAC I-PER|I-FAC I-PER|I-FAC I-PER|I-FAC|B-GPE I-PER|I-FAC|I-GPE I-PER|I-FAC|I-GPE L-PER|L-FAC|L-GPE|U-GPE O O O O O O O O
A man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came to the checkpoint , waved soldiers over , appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-VEH I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-VEH L-PER|L-VEH O O B-FAC L-FAC O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
As the soldiers approached , the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers .	O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O U-WEA O B-VEH L-VEH O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
This is something that Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place .	O O O O B-PER|B-PER|U-GPE I-PER|I-PER I-PER|L-PER L-PER O O O O O O
He said this long before the conflict ever began .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O
He reiterated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U . S . troops with suicide bombing similar to this .

Also , in southern Iraq today near Basra , two members - claimed to be members of Saddam ' s Thataeen ( ph ) group surrendered to U .

At the Pentagon briefing today , General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism .	O O U-ORG O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O
It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this , it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics , techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC|U-FAC O O O O
So it won ' t change our overall rules of engagement .	O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O
It doesn ' t effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O
So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles .	O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|U-WEA L-WEA O
Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures .	B-WEA|U-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|B-LOC I-VEH|I-LOC I-VEH|L-LOC I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|B-LOC I-VEH|I-LOC L-VEH|L-LOC O O O O O O O
The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia .	B-ORG L-ORG O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|B-WEA I-WEA|I-WEA|U-WEA L-WEA|L-WEA O O O O U-GPE O O B-GPE L-GPE O
No injuries reported .	O O O O
The missiles are programmed so that they don ' t detonate until they reach their target .	B-WEA L-WEA O O O O U-WEA O O O O O U-WEA O U-WEA O O
If they go astray , then the warheads never arm but claiming that it ' s about one percent of the warheads .	O U-WEA O O O O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O O O O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|B-WEA L-WEA|L-WEA O

Chris , very quickly , new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein ' s ongoing air defense capability ?	U-PER O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O
Well , no major concern .	O O O O O O
The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact .	B-ORG L-ORG O O U-ORG O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O B-LOC L-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC|B-LOC I-LOC|L-LOC I-LOC|U-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC|B-WEA I-LOC|I-WEA I-LOC|I-WEA I-LOC|L-WEA I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O
The reason that they ' re still in tact according to today ' s briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don ' t turn them on , the U . S . has trouble locating them .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O U-WEA O
They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they ' ll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad . Judy . . .	U-ORG O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O U-PER O O O

You ' re looking at live pictures of Baghdad where there have been more strikes , more bombs dropped , more missiles this evening and of course as always , CNN keeping a close eye , a close watch , a close listen on what ' s going on in Baghdad .

Ken Pollack , that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with , you and I were talking earlier today .	B-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O
The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you ' re telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O O
Right .	O O
I mean we ' re seeing one of the great advantages of U . S . and British forces now , Judy , which is that they ' re superbly trained troops .	U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O
They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they ' re adapting .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face .	U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O
The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it , risks to the supply line , risks in terms of not clearing cities and they ' re shifting .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O O O O O O O U-GPE O U-PER O O O O
They ' re changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that .	U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
You ' ve seen U . S . Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines , get control over the cities and so I think that U . S . and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield .	U-PER O O O B-ORG|B-GPE I-ORG|I-GPE I-ORG|L-GPE I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-ORG L-PER|L-ORG O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O U-PER O O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O O
So as an onlooker , as somebody who ' s studied the Iraqi capabilities , is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with ?	O O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O U-PER O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O U-GPE O O O
Absolutely .	O O
One of the things I think we ' re likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U . S . forces are .	O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O O
Typically what you ' ve seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top .	O O U-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O
It doesn ' t come from the ground up .	O O O O O O O O O O
You don ' t have ground commanders calling back and saying hey , we ' d like to try this tactic or this seems to work .	U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tell everybody else to do the same thing .	O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O
Instead the high command has to identify a problem , come up with a solution and transmit it down .	O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we ' ve seen before , irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U . S . forces , some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops .	O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O
There ' s no way around that but U . S . forces , British forces are beginning to adapt to it .	O O O O O O O O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O O
I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary Iraqi people .	U-PER O O O U-PER O U-PER O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O
I just interviewed a gentleman , native of Iraq , who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in Baghdad 20 , 30 , 50 of them and he said they do the view the Americans as invaders .	U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER U-GPE O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O U-GPE B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O
They hate Saddam Hussein .	U-PER O B-PER L-PER O
They don ' t like what he ' s doing but they don ' t think the Americans are the answer .	U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O
All right .	O O O
Well , this is something that we ' ve been trying to get a grip on for years , exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do , they despise .	O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O
They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token , they don ' t like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that , I think it ' s probably most important for most Iraqis is they ' re deeply suspicious of the United States .	U-GPE O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O B-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991 .	U-PER O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O U-PER O O O
The U . S . didn ' t finish Saddam then .	B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O U-PER O O

Hello , again , Jamie .	O O O O U-PER O
Well Judy , the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn ' t seen for awhile .	O U-PER O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O
First of all , as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN , the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U . S . troops , that taking place in Najaf .

Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U .

O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O B-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|L-ORG L-PER O B-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O O O O U-GPE O O O B-GPE L-GPE O
They met lighter than expected resistance .	U-PER O O O O O O
But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad , this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so - called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons , and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon .	O B-PER I-PER|U-ORG L-PER O O O U-PER O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O

We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains , or anything like that .	U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
So , in regard to that , we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground .	O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O
They may just suddenly be effective on the ground .	U-PER O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O
Additionally , their ability to use chemical and biological weapons , they ' ve proven it historically .	O O U-PER O O O B-WEA|U-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|U-WEA L-WEA O U-PER O O O O O O
We believe they have the capability now .	U-PER O U-PER O O O O O
Clearly , as we threaten the core of the regime , which Baghdad and Tikrit represent , we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up .	O O O U-PER O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O B-WEA L-WEA O O O

Well , they might be .	O O U-PER O O O
And that might be a good thing .	O O O O O O O O
They are taking it very cautiously .	U-PER O O O O O O
No one , again , they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead .	B-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
Could be urban combat .	O O O O O
Could involve chemical weapons .	O O B-WEA L-WEA O
Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad .	O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O U-GPE O
Could be a very dangerous time .	O O O O O O O

Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark	O O O O O O O O O
Thanks very much , Judy .	O O O O U-PER O
And Colonel Leonhard , we ' re going to talk a little bit about urban combat .	O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that Blackhawk down scenario , Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O
This is not probably a comparable situation , is it ?	O O O O O O O O O O O
Not in any way .	O O O O O
And one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in Baghdad , and we will use them .	O O O O O O O U-ORG O B-VEH I-VEH L-VEH B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE|U-GPE O O U-ORG O O U-VEH O
Those tanks have 120 - millimeter smoothbore gun on them .	B-VEH L-VEH O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O U-VEH O
The Bradleys have 25 - millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns .	B-VEH L-VEH O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O B-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O
That ' s a lot of mobile protective gunfire .	O O O O O O O O O O
Completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles .	O O O O U-GPE O O O U-ORG O O O B-VEH L-VEH O
And we also are not going to use similar tactics there .	O U-ORG O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
We are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All right .	O O O
We want to show you an animation , and share with our viewers , maybe you can point out a few things about this .	U-ORG O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER|U-ORG L-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
If we move in on Baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat .	O U-GPE O O O U-GPE O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What we ' ve depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here , right over here is a mosque .	O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O
We depict that to show that ' s something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O U-GPE O
As we get a little bit closer here , in a typical scenario like this , you might very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this , and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti - aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O B-PER|B-ORG I-PER|L-ORG L-PER O O U-FAC O U-FAC O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC|U-FAC O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O B-FAC|U-WEA L-FAC O O O
What we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in .	O U-PER O O O O B-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O B-VEH L-VEH O O O
How much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city ?	O O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH|U-VEH O O U-VEH O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O B-GPE L-GPE O
It ' s a great question .	O O O O O O O
I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment , and that is why movement through an urban area is very , very dangerous .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O
It ' s the side that ' s moving that ' s going to take the casualties .	U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER U-PER O O O O O O O O
That said , the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they ' re moving a little bit faster as than we probably will .	O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH U-VEH U-PER O O U-VEH O O U-PER O O U-VEH O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O
We ' ll use patience and finesse .	U-ORG O O O O O O O

And then we ' ll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable , to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone .	O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O U-ORG O O O O O O
At which time we can engage them or arrest them .	O O O U-ORG O O U-PER O O U-PER O
We ' d like to resume with that animation if we could .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O
That ' s Saddam International Airport .	O O O B-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O
That ' s another segment .	O O O O O O
Can we get back to the animation .	O U-ORG O O O O O O
And I ' d like to just finish this out .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
Here we go .	O U-PER O O
Ad we move it along , you ' ll see eventually the troops will come marching in .	O U-ORG O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O
In this case , slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door .	O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O
Typically , when they ' d assault a target like this , they ' d do what ?	O O O U-PER O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC|U-FAC O U-PER O O O O O
Well , typically , if they do go in , which is generally the option of last resort , but if we do have to go in , often we ' ll try to go in from the top of the building down .	O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-FAC L-FAC|L-FAC O O
One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings , and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill .	O O O O O O U-ORG O U-WEA O O O O U-FAC O O U-WEA O O O O O O O O
So , you always want them going down staircases rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase .	O O U-PER O O U-WEA O O U-FAC O O O O O O O U-WEA O B-FAC L-FAC O

WASHINGTON , April 28 ( AFP ) - North Korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs , but only in return for " considerable " diplomatic , political and economic concessions , the United States said Monday .

Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three - way talks between US , North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing .

At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons , and threatened to prove it with a " display . "	O O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O O O O O O O O
" The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and , in effect , said that these are now up for further discussion , " he told reporters at the State Department .

" They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities , but they , of course , expect something considerable in return , " Powell said .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O U-GPE U-WEA O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
" We are studying that plan , we are examining it with our friends and allies , " Powell said , adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean , Japanese , Russian and Australian as well as other governments .

" It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here , " he said , referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer , and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions .	U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O
However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands .	O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O
The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States , security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations .	O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" They had quite a list of things , " State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O B-PER|B-PER|B-ORG I-PER|I-PER|L-ORG I-PER|L-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O
Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance , Boucher replied : " I don ' t really quibble with that characterization of the list . "	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a " concise description . "	B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|L-ORG L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" It basically listed everything they have ever asked for , " the official told reporters on condition of anonymity , identifying oil and energy supplies as demands .	O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the North Korean demands are being looked at , Boucher repeated long - standing US policy that Washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off .	O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O
" We ' ve made clear we ' re not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place , " he said .	O U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks , but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words " test " or " testing . "	U-PER O O B-GPE L-GPE O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another , " he said .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a " bold " proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing , officials said .	O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O B-GPE L-GPE O O U-GPE O U-PER O O
South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six - month - old nuclear crisis .	B-ORG|B-GPE I-ORG|L-GPE L-ORG O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides , stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the " verifiable and irreversible termination " of the north ' s nuclear programs .	U-PER O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O
" We ( have ) made clear that once North Korea did that , we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to US - North Korea relations that we had talked about before , " he said .

i wasn ' t taking risks .	U-PER O O O O O O
i wasn ' t in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , saddam hussein made the only self criticism .

he was right about that .	U-PER O O O O O
but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - year ' s war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we ' re arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in ' 91 when it could have been finished .

Vioxx : Slightly Bigger Deal than we Thought ?	O O O O O O O O O
Merck posted a 21 % decline in earnings thanks to the new post - Vioxx announcement .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx , representing about 11 % of sales , now represents a pretty severe legal headache : Not only have they lost the revenue , but they ' ve taken a $ 600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx losses .

The rhetoric we ' re hearing - - that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars - - doesn ' t match the reality that in a few cases , they manipulated bids , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have been .
