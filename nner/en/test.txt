Welcome back .	O O O
Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country .	O B-ORG L-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG|U-PER L-ORG O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O B-GPE L-GPE O
President Bush points this way today , even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money , premiums go up and either way , the patient pays .	B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O
We ' re debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader , and AMA President - Elect Dr . Ronald Palmisano .	U-PER O O O O O O B-PER|B-PER|U-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER L-PER O O B-PER|B-PER|U-ORG I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
Dr . Palmisano , again , thanks for staying with us through the break .	B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else ' s lawsuits , but instead focus on his own experience .	O U-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O
He was the governor of my state of Texas , where there are a whole lot of doctors .

It turns out that he didn ' t do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O
Here ' s what the " Dallas Morning News " reported recently : " The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners , the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations .	O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|U-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|B-PER L-ORG|L-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-ORG I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors , who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized .	U-ORG O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER L-PER O
It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O
Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is the Bush record in policing surgeons , why should we trust him now ?	O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O U-PER O O
Well , first off . . .	O O O O O O O
Physicians generally , not just surgeons , forgive me .	U-PER O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O
What we need to do is to make sure that state boards , number one , have adequate funding .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O B-ORG|U-GPE L-ORG O O O O O O O O
The AMA supports that .	B-ORG L-ORG O O O
If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine .	O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER U-ORG O U-PER O O O O O O O
But it ' s also . . .	O O O O O O O O
( CROSSTALK )	O O O
. . . bad doctors ?	O O O B-PER L-PER O
Well , it ' s also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because someone pays money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they ' re afraid there ' s is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system .	O U-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Troy Brennan ( ph ) of Harvard said there ' s no correlation with negligence , only with disability .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So let ' s look at all of the facts , but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize .	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE|U-GPE O U-PER O O
Actually , Troy Brennan , the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits , it ' s too many .	O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG|U-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-ORG L-PER|L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Less than 10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice , and we ' re talking about horrific injuries here , even file a claim .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even file a claim .	O O O O O
And the entire pay - out to all of the victims that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amounts to less than what we spend on dog food .	O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|U-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O
On dog food .	O O O O
It ' s about $ 5 . 4 billion is the pay - out .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That ' s a fraction of physician income .	O O O O O O U-PER O O
It ' s a fraction of the health care expense of 1 . 4 trillion .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That ' s what the people in Congress have to do .	O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-ORG O O O O
They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care .	U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O
Doctors are going . . .	U-PER O O O O O
But let me - but let me - wait . . .	O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O
Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium , right ?	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
Is that right ?	O O O O
They don ' t abandon their patients , except for the high premiums of a few specialties ?	U-PER O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of the premiums .	O O O O O
But first of all let me . . .	O O O O O U-PER O O O
Why don ' t you crack down on the insurance companies ?	O O O O U-PER O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
Let ' s talk about the facts .	O O U-PER O O O O O
Let ' s talk about the facts .	O O U-PER O O O O O
That ' s the fact .	O O O O O O
( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) percent of the doctors are insured by physician - owned insurance companies , the medical side .	O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER L-PER|L-PER O O O B-ORG|U-PER I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O
I was just in Oklahoma , they own this insurance company .	U-PER O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
They are trying to do their very best .	U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O O O
It ' s a company not for profit .	U-ORG O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And as far as the investment income , A . M . Bests ( ph ) show that in the past five years , the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent .	O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis .	B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O
( CROSSTALK )	O O O
. . . payoffs have been stable , adjusted for inflation , National Practitioners Databank ( ph ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why do you want that to be secret ?	O O U-PER O O O O O O
All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank , you , the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list .	O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER|U-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
Well , let ' s look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor .	O O O O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O
Let ' s listen to what he said to the AMA today .	O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O B-ORG L-ORG O O
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )	O O O O O
If harmed by a doc , they ought to be able to recover their economic costs , economic losses .	O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
They should be able to recover non - economic damages as well .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
But for the sake of the system , non - economic damages should be capped at $ 250 , 000 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( END VIDEO CLIP )	O O O O O
What in the world is wrong with that ?	O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O
Tell me what ' s wrong with that ?	O U-PER O O O O O O O
What ' s wrong ?	O O O O O
Tell someone who had a double mastectomy , tell an infant who ' s brain - damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they ' re going to get dribbled out $ 250 , 000 for their entire life expectancy ?

The head of AIG a few years ago was making $ 250 , 000 every week .	B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money , though .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I wish I could have been at a Pub , or wherever these people convene , to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning ( emphasis added ) : Britain ' s gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert .

Europe Changing Their Tune ?	O O O O O
American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O
It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush .	O O O B-ORG I-ORG|U-GPE L-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O
Why you ask ?	O U-PER O O
But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From a European perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House .	O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG|U-PER I-ORG L-ORG O
One is the death of Yasser Arafat .	O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli - Palestinian dispute .	O O O U-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O
For the last few years , Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat .	O O O O O O U-GPE O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O U-PER O
That another reason why I respect Bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat .	O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER U-PER O
May he rot in hell .	O U-PER O O U-LOC O
But since Arafat ' s death , Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground : supporting Ariel Sharon ' s withdrawal from Gaza , putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and , covertly , backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader .	O O U-PER O O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-GPE O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O
A second reason is Europe ' s growing worries about Islamic terrorism .	O O O O U-GPE O O O O O U-PER O O
The murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe ' s 9 / 11 .	O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O U-GPE O O O O O O
Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that American conservatives , such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O
You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ?	U-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O
Get outta here . . . . Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9 / 11 to cry about .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O O O
The third force is the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that kept the trans - Atlantic alliance together for half a century .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE|B-LOC I-GPE|I-LOC I-GPE|L-LOC L-GPE O O O O O O

They should be very worried about this item , I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was .	U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O U-GPE O O O U-GPE O O O
Hopefully our Government isn ' t asleep at the wheel with this situation either .	O B-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is a personal edge to all this .	O O O O O O O O O

Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history : that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House .	B-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|I-ORG L-PER|L-ORG O
His thumping re - election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O
In short , Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception , but the U .

Blockbuster / Hollywood - - A debt - based hostile takeover ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' ve been keeping a careful eye on the Blockbuster / Hollywood machinations for a while ( and well I should - - I have stock in one of the deal ' s participants , Movie Gallery ) , but even so I ' m surprised that Blockbuster ' s latest gambit is to buy up Hollywood ' s debt .

It ' s an admirable hedge - - if Movie Gallery wins , it could improve Hollywood ' s rating , and either way it offers Blockbuster some leverage .	O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O

I ' d love to call it a classic raid - - he ' s making an offer for the company , nominating his own board , claiming management can accept one or the other or both , and hinting that if they paid him enough , he ' d probably go away .

But the whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent , and that means the strategy changes constantly .	O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O
In this case , the most interesting twist is that he ' s shorting shares of Mylan ' s acquisition target , King Pharmaceuticals ; he ' s basically doubling down on the bet that they won ' t acquire .

In 1994 , I was a graduate student in Boston .	O O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O

The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship , sustainable profitability , working with passion .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It is not coming from the faculty , or the alumni , or the administration .	O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O B-ORG L-ORG O
All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences .	B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O

A little secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount of sway .	O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O
Few choose to use it , but if they want they can fundamentally change their school .	U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O B-ORG|U-PER L-ORG O
Right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes , are initiating service projects , forming support group for social entrepreneurs , inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability , social investing , non - profit innovations , etc .

Net Impact is often at the center of these efforts .	B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O
These are not isolated events . . . This is a revolution from within .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large .	U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O

Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks .	O U-PER O O O O O O U-ORG O
I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday .	U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
This may partially justify a higher P / E ratio .	O O O O O O O O O O O
A couple weeks ago , I observed that Wal - Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators .	O O O O O U-PER O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O
Starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O
Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators .	U-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O
Not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators .	O O O U-ORG O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O
Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O
In the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues .	O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-ORG O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries .	O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
This is a strategic shift that has short - term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis , several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O
Starbucks has little debt .	U-ORG O O O O
Starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt .	U-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O O O
Considering its growth , this is amazing .	O U-ORG O O O O O O
It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth .	O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O
The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting its risk profile because . . .	B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O
Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O
This allows the company to grow without debt .	O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O
You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders .	U-PER O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O
This option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future .	O O O O O O U-ORG O O U-ORG O O O O O
Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising .	U-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|B-FAC|U-ORG L-ORG|L-FAC O O O O
While Starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , Barnes & Noble ) , most of its stores are company owned .	O U-ORG O O O U-ORG O U-FAC O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-FAC|U-ORG L-FAC|L-FAC O U-ORG O O
From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .	O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
I cannot say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P / E ratio than the industry norm .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Risk is lower .	O O O O
Interesting aside : Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme .	O O O U-ORG O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-GPE|U-PER I-FAC|L-GPE I-FAC|U-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-ORG L-FAC|L-ORG O
