He explained he could better spend the next two years on homeland security , the economy and judicial nominations .	U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O

It could swell to as much as $ 500 billion if we go to war in Iraq .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O
Mr . Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse .	B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O

Number one , there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

And number two , there is no Social Security fund , Virginia .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O

Here to debate medical malpractice reform are consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Dr . Donald Palmisano , the president - elect of the American Medical Association .

Ralph Nader , there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can ' t afford the medical malpractice rates .	B-PER L-PER O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE U-GPE O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG U-GPE U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
We ' ll just run a scroll of some of the states .	U-ORG O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
They ' re big states .	U-GPE O O B-GPE L-GPE O
Florida , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Texas .	U-GPE O B-GPE L-GPE O B-GPE L-GPE O U-GPE O U-GPE O U-GPE O U-GPE O
This is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on America , isn ' t it ?	O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-GPE O O O O O O
Another one of your leading questions .	O O O U-PER O O O
This is a medical malpractice crisis .	O O O O O O O
Over 80 , 000 Americans , 220 every day die from medical negligence , hundred of thousands are injured .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O
And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income , its interest income , the stock market collapse down .	O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|U-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|U-PER I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O U-ORG O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O
And so they ' re jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons .	O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O
But if you take the entire amount of premiums , Bob , that ' s paid by doctors in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly , they ' d be paying less than $ 9 , 000 each .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE L-PER|L-GPE O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
That ' s one - third of what they pay a receptionist .	O O O O O O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O
That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can ' t afford it .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O
You know , Ralph , you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics .	U-PER O O U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
Can you say that the lawyers , the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic coffers in order to keep this , do you believe that this is healthy . . .

Well , as much as they ' ve poured into those coffers , it ' s much less than what the doctors , the malpractice insurers , the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress ' coffers .

This is first and foremost , Bob , a question of equity .	O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that ' s the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn ' t indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest , or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17 - year - old teenager in North Carolina .

Are we going to say to these and so many others , you can ' t have your full day in court ?	O U-PER O O O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O U-FAC O
The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level ?	B-ORG L-ORG O O O O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-PER|I-GPE L-PER|L-PER|L-GPE O O B-ORG|U-GPE L-ORG O O
I haven ' t yet met one senator or representative who ' s for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent , unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases .

Isn ' t he right ?	O O O U-PER O O
Isn ' t our president wrong to be - - did he win the Lottery ?	O O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
You know , Mr . Bush - - President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery .	U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O
Does that look like a Lottery winner to you , holding a picture of his dead baby ?	O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
Well , the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can ' t get access to care .	O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O O O
The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system .	B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That ' s why we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation .	O O O O U-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
The current system doesn ' t measure negligence .	O O O O O O O O O
It measures disability .	O O O O
And what we ' re finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing , trauma centers are closing , pregnant women can ' t find a doctor to deliver the baby , a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state .

Those are important points , I don ' t doubt .	O O O O O U-PER O O O O O
But I wonder if you can respond to Mr . McCormick ' s point .	O U-PER O O U-PER O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O
Who are you , who ' s our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $ 250 , 000 for the loss of a child ?	U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
Well , what has to be done here is balance .	O O O O O O O O O O O
What we need is a system that ' s fair to everyone , a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O

It brought stability to California and obstetricians in California will pay 55 , 57 , $ 60 , 000 in Los Angeles and in South Florida in Miami , they ' ll pay $ 210 , 000 . . .

Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels .	O O U-GPE U-GPE O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O
And in Florida , they ' ve been very weak on it .	O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O O O O
And in some states , for example , there are doctors that are - - you know , there are 45 payouts in ten years and they ' re not disciplined by the state medical board .

First of all , the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used .	O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O

For example - - wait a second - - in Iran , the reason that you had Ayatollah Khomeini in power is he overthrew the Shah .	O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O U-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O

Hello , everybody .	O O U-PER O
Welcome to CROSSFIRE .	O O O O
On this Ash Wednesday , the pope asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for peace , while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another case for war .	O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O
We will debate all of that as well as " Vanity Fair " ' s latest , stunning revelations about Michael Jackson .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
Believe it or not , we got new news on Michael Jackson .	O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O
Do you think he really looks like a mummy ?	O U-PER O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O
Certainly not a daddy .	O O B-PER L-PER O
But first , our own little moonwalk across the political landscape , the " CROSSFIRE Political Alert . "	O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The foreign ministers of France , Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American - backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE I-PER I-PER|U-GPE I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG|B-ORG I-ORG|L-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq , and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end , that ' s just what he ' ll get .	B-PER|U-PER L-PER O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O U-GPE O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence - sitting Security Council member , the African nation of Guinea , because he said - - quote - - " I used to have one of their pigs . "	B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE|B-ORG I-GPE|L-ORG L-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE|U-GPE O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O O
So - - OK , I made that up .	O O O O O U-PER O O O O
He didn ' t say that .	U-PER O O O O O O
Well , I suspected that .	O O U-PER O O O
You know . . .	U-PER O O O O
But they are a swing vote .	O U-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
Guinea is an important swing vote .	U-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
As is Cameroon .	O O U-GPE O
France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying , Look , they ' re working .	U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We don ' t need war .	U-PER O O O O O O
They ' re not pointing out that inspections are working only because there ' s the credible threat of war .	U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Saddam wouldn ' t be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he didn ' t .	U-PER O O O O O U-WEA O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
I think that ' s a good point .	U-PER O O O O O O O O
It doesn ' t mean we have to go to war .	O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O
But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force .	O U-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It means when you take the threat of force of the table , you ' re likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein .	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
Yes , I ' m not saying take the threat of force .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
I ' m saying we don ' t need to use force right now .	U-PER O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
Well , France and Germany would like to .	O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O

Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament - - quote - - " too little , too late " gestures , meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction .	U-PER O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O B-WEA|U-GPE I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O
U . S . intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al - Samoud 2 missiles , even as it destroys existing ones , missiles that until recently , it claimed not to have .	B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O U-PER O U-GPE O O O O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O O O U-GPE O B-WEA L-WEA O B-WEA I-WEA|U-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|U-GPE I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O

In order to secure peace , Powell concluded , the international community must confront Saddam Hussein ' s refusal to disarm - - quote - - " here and now . "	O O O O O O U-PER O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , there you have it .	O O O U-PER O O O
The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein .	O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-PER L-PER O
The only question left : who do you believe ?	O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O
Secretary of State Colin Powell or France ?	B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|L-PER|U-ORG I-PER L-PER O U-GPE O
No , the question is . . .	O O O O O O O O
That is the question .	O O O O O
Who do you believe : the Bush administration or your lying eyes ?	U-PER O U-PER O O B-ORG I-ORG|U-PER L-ORG O U-PER O O O
We are watching them destroy weapons , as the president says , Oh , that ' s just a hoax .	U-PER O O U-GPE O U-WEA O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
But Paul . . .	O U-PER O O O
They are disarming .	U-GPE O O O
No , no , no that ' s not what the president ' s saying .	O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O
He ' s saying , the - - it ' s a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-WEA O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA|U-GPE O
Keep in mind , these are weapons that Saddam Hussein , until recently , said he didn ' t even have .	O O O O U-WEA O B-WEA I-WEA|U-WEA I-WEA|B-PER I-WEA|L-PER I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|U-PER I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O
He ' s a liar .	U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O
Of course .	O O O
And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him - - foolish task , don ' t you think ?	O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
Absolutely .	O O
Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein .	U-PER O B-PER L-PER O
The question is , Is he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and women .	O O O O O U-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O B-PER|B-PER|U-GPE I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O
That ' s a separate question .	O O O O O O O
That ' s a very separate question .	O O O O O O O O
I think he ' s not .	U-PER O U-PER O O O O
I think the inspections can work .	U-PER O O O O O O

Well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : MSNBC , an obscure cable channel , has fired Phil Donahue , the host of its highest - rated show .

A memo from inside NBC , reported on the Web site allyourtv . com , and today in " The Washington Post , " shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr . Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo - - quote - - " a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war , while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti - war , anti - Bush and skeptical of the administration ' s motives . "	O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O B-PER|U-ORG I-PER L-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O B-ORG|U-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|L-ORG I-PER I-PER L-PER O O
So there it is , according to NBC .	O O O O O O O U-ORG O
Phil Donahue was fired because he ' s a liberal .	B-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O
In fact , the only liberal with the solo cable talk show .	O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O

I don ' t know if you ' ve listened to Phil Donahue .	U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O

But the arguments , actually , don ' t hold up very well .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Have you noticed that ?	O U-PER O O O
You know , you can argue back and forth , but you shouldn ' t fire someone because of their political views and that ' s what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation .

We ' re talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel , a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King .	U-ORG O O O O O O O U-GPE O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|L-GPE L-PER O B-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER B-PER|B-PER|U-ORG I-PER|L-PER I-PER L-PER O
Mr . King , thanks for stying with us through the break .	B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O U-ORG O O O O
One of the reasons that we like having you on , and as well as Mr . Rangel , is that , you know , this is war , as we were saying in the last segment .	O O O O O U-ORG O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O
You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you ' re a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests .	O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER|U-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE|U-PER I-PER|L-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
So I wonder if you ' ll join Charlie Rangel , who put out a press release today , decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations .	O U-PER O O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O
Isn ' t that wrong in a time of war ?	O O O O O O O O O O O
The important thing is that the bill pass for the military .	O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O
If the other stuff ' s in there , it ' s there .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean to me , the main purpose should be the military .	U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O
I ' m not going to disagree with Charlie ' s point .	U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
On the other hand , often when bills are passed , there are things attached to them .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So to me , the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that ' s what we should do .	O O U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O U-GPE O O O
Congressman Rangel , a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said - - made the charge that we are , quote , " we haven ' t made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda . "	B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O
A lot of Democrats said similar things .	B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O

Doesn ' t it turn out that Mr . Daschle and others didn ' t know what they were talking about and maybe they shouldn ' t make charges like that in public when they don ' t know what they were talking about ?	O O O O O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O
You would agree with that , wouldn ' t you ?	U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O
If they don ' t have the pencil that ' s keeping score , they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor , every drug dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world .

Why wasn ' t he No .	O O O O U-PER O O

I think that puts you pretty high up in the organization .	U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O
( CROSSTALK )	O O O
Let me tell you , when you arrest somebody , you describe who you ' re arresting .	O U-PER O U-PER O O U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O U-PER U-PER O O O O
I haven ' t the slightest clue who this guy was .	U-PER O O O O O O U-PER B-PER L-PER O O
I haven ' t heard anybody suggest that he ' s not one of the central figures in al Qaeda .	U-PER O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|B-ORG L-PER|L-PER|L-ORG O
Have you ?	O U-PER O
Listen , we should be arresting a lot of people .	O O U-GPE O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
But I think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden , we should concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein .	O U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O O U-GPE O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-GPE O O O O B-PER L-PER O
We should do all of those things , but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the . . .	U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O
A defenseless nation ?	B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
They have biological weapons .	U-GPE O B-WEA|U-WEA L-WEA O
How are they defenseless ?	O O U-GPE O O
And how ' d they get them ?	O O O O U-GPE O U-WEA O
Listen , if this is . . .	O O O O O O O O
It was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons ?	O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O B-WEA|U-WEA I-WEA I-WEA|U-WEA L-WEA O
Come on .	O O O
Let me tell you .	O U-PER O U-PER O
They have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting Iran so it ' s no big deal there .	U-GPE O U-WEA O U-GPE O U-GPE O U-WEA O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O
And the thing is that if we can disarm them without actually going there , killing them , I really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world .	O O O O O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O U-PER O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O B-LOC L-LOC O
We have a lot of people . . .	U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O

I mean , what happens if India decides that they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan ?	U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O O O O O U-GPE O
What happens if the North Koreans take another look ?	O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O
Our country is great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we ' re right .	B-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O U-GPE O O O O
I don ' t think we have to kill to prove that .	U-PER O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O

" I recall , as reported in ' The Wall Street Journal , ' that the transactions were legal .	O U-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O
Is it possible that the equipment allowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by the U . N . ? "	O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O
They were legal because Mr . Cheney ' s company used a loophole .	O O O O B-ORG|B-PER|U-PER I-ORG|I-PER I-ORG|L-PER I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O
They went through a foreign subsidiary .	U-ORG O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
But they did enrich Saddam Hussein and his evil , ruthless regime , and they were immoral .	O U-ORG O O B-PER L-PER O B-ORG|U-PER I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O U-ORG O O O
They were wrong .	U-ORG O O O
Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with Saddam Hussein .	B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
I would agree with that .	U-PER O O O O O
What does that have to do with the war in Iraq ?	O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
It means Cheney is a hypocrite .	O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O
He ' s trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers .	U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER|U-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O

No , no , you ' re attacking - - OK great .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O
That ' s great .	O O O O O
But it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not .	O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O U-GPE O O O

Chad Hensley , from Fairfax , Virginia , writes , " France , Russia and German have all multi - billion dollar oil deals with Saddam in Iraq .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE L-PER|L-GPE|U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-GPE O
I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq .	U-PER O O U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O
It must be the humanitarian reasons . "	O O O O O O O O
Well , Chad , that ' s what liberals assume .	O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O
That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds , but the U . S . is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
It is a weird assumption , don ' t you think ?	O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
As you know , I ' ve never said that .	O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O
You haven ' t .	U-PER O O O O
I don ' t believe for a minute that this is a war for oil .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think it ' s unwise , it ' s unjust , it ' s unwarranted , but I don ' t think it ' s about oil .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
Now , the reason that France , Russia and Germany are against war is because they have democracies .	O O O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O U-GPE O O O O O U-GPE O O O
The people are against it .	B-GPE L-GPE O O O O
It ' s called democracy .	O O O O O O

Thank you very much , Judy .	O U-PER O O O U-PER O
To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones , and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard , we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang .	O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-WEA O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O U-ORG O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
He ' s retired with the United States Army .	U-PER O O O O B-ORG I-ORG|B-GPE I-ORG|L-GPE L-ORG O
He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency , among other things .	U-PER O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O
Colonel , good to have you with us .	U-PER O O O O U-PER O U-ORG O
You ' re welcome .	U-PER O O O O
What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance ?	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U . S . and coalition supply lines ?	O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O B-FAC I-FAC|B-GPE I-FAC|I-GPE I-FAC|L-GPE I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|U-GPE I-FAC L-FAC O
Or both ?	O O O
Well , they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock , food , fuel and ammunition .	O O U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-WEA O
So , probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind , that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O B-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|L-ORG L-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-FAC|U-PER I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O U-ORG O O O
Once they are satisfied they are through all that , I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad , probing hard to see how much resistance there really is .	O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , let me ask you that .	O O O U-PER O U-PER O O
First of all , I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery .	O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O U-ORG O O U-ORG O O O
This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad .	U-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC|U-GPE I-LOC I-LOC|U-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC|U-GPE O
Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there .	U-GPE O O O O O O U-LOC O
We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles .	U-ORG O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O
One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport .	B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC L-FAC|L-LOC O B-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O
Do you suppose that is a key target right now ?	O U-PER O U-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O O O
Oh , I ' m sure it is .	O O U-PER O O O U-FAC O O
I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you ' d want to hold .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
And besides , as soon as you get control of it you ' d be able to start using it for air operations , and put a survey team in there as soon as it ' s secured , and then start using it for helicopter operations , haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that .	O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-FAC U-PER O O O O O O O U-FAC O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-FAC O O O U-FAC O O O O O O O O U-FAC O U-VEH O O O O O O O O O O O U-VEH O O U-VEH O O O O O
And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad , they ' ll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well .	O O O O O O U-FAC O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O U-PER O O O O U-FAC O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O O O
Now , as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big , wide divided highways there .	O O O U-PER O O B-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O U-GPE U-PER O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC U-GPE O
Control of these highways will be crucial won ' t it ?	O O B-FAC L-FAC O O O O O O O O
Yeah , these are the high - speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high - speed approaches .	O O U-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC I-FAC|I-LOC|B-GPE L-FAC|L-LOC|L-GPE O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O
They will try to go down those things , cutting the city up into sectors as best they can , and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain .	U-PER O O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O O B-GPE L-GPE O O U-LOC O O U-PER O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC|B-GPE I-LOC|L-GPE I-LOC|U-PER I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC|B-LOC I-LOC|I-LOC L-LOC|L-LOC O
I would think , probably , various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government .	U-PER O O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O O O B-FAC I-FAC|U-ORG I-FAC I-FAC|U-FAC I-FAC|U-GPE I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC|B-GPE I-FAC|I-GPE L-FAC|L-GPE O
It ' s a big city , about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts .	U-GPE O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O U-GPE O O O
Some have said Chicago is a good analogy .	U-PER O O U-GPE O O O O O
Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source , or am a wrong ?	O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O U-PER O O
Well , it depends on the attitude of the populous , which is not clear yet .	O O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O
If the population , in fact , or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population , if they want to be liberated , then you can control them with a fairly small force .	O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER|U-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|B-GPE L-PER|L-PER|L-GPE O O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
If , in fact , a lot of people in the city don ' t want to be liberated and you ' re never going to know that until you try , then you ' re going to need a much larger force , and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements .	O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE L-PER|L-GPE O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-PER O
Based on what you ' ve seen so far , what is your sense of that ?	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
The Shias are a bit gun shy , if you will , in the south because of what happened in 1991 .	B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O
They rose up , didn ' t get American support .	U-PER O O O O O O O U-GPE O O
Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad ?	O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out ?	O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O
Yes , there is , but these folks are going to be mighty cautious .	O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O
They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER|B-PER|U-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-LOC L-PER|L-LOC O
And they don ' t have any particular reason to trust us , so far .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
So they ' ll wait and see what happens .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O
It ' s the other people in the city you have to worry about , who are ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime .	O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE L-PER|L-GPE U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|L-PER L-PER O

The doctor has completed one surgery on her back .	B-PER L-PER O O O O O U-PER O O
They have released the pressure on a nerve , and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it , and that was because she didn ' t have any feeling in her feet .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O

For more now on the unique challenges posed by urban combat , let ' s go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just heard , Miles O ' Brien .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O U-GPE O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER|U-ORG I-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
Hello again , Miles .	O O O U-PER O
Hello again , Judy .	O O O U-PER O
I ' m joined by J . Kelly McCann , our security analyst , a man who ' s spent a lot of time learning about urban combat .	U-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O B-PER|U-ORG I-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
You know , just those two words together , I think , scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong .	U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O
You know , I ' m impressed , looking at this map , it almost looks like a chess game , kind of sterile .	U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is - - couldn ' t be further from the truth , could it ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Absolutely not .	O O O
This is very clean and it ' s very orderly .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there , you ' ll see just how conflicted an environment that is .	O O U-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
And all happening so quickly .	O O O O O O
( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .	O O O O
Let ' s roll some tape .	O O U-ORG O O O O
We ' re going to kind of play it and stop it , and Kelly ' s going to walk us through , I guess , Urban Combat 101 .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-ORG O O U-PER O O O O O O
What are we seeing here ?	O O U-ORG O O O
Just there , I mean , just getting the door out of the way , you can see where the weapons have to go .	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O
Now , you just see this soldier right here , he ' s going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile .	O O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O B-WEA|U-PER L-WEA O O O O O O O O
And he ' s got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here .	O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O
Now , he ' s going to go that direction , because that room is clear .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O O O
Go ahead and stop the tape . As you make every entry , Miles , there are two dead spots , one , of course , in this direction right here , which you can ' t see from the doorway , the other in this direction right here , and that ' s always the problem , because as you come in here , you ' ve got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here doesn ' t get shot in the back .	O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O
All right .	O O O
Now , what about this , this armor ?	O O O O O O O O O
Tell us how they ' re equipped with armor there .	O U-ORG O U-PER O O O O O O O
Level 4 armor , this is not just for frag .	O O O O O O O O O O O
This will also stop bullets .	O O O O U-WEA O
And there ' s a difference .	O O O O O O O
The normal flak jacket will stop fragments from grenades , et cetera .	O O O O O O O O U-WEA O O O O
This is a plate that will actually stop and deform a bullet .	O O O O O O O O O O B-WEA L-WEA O
All right .	O O O
Let ' s roll tape and continue on here and talk about - - Now , I notice his hand - - his sidearm is attached to him .	O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O B-WEA|U-PER L-WEA O O O U-PER O
That ' s for . . .	O O O O O O O

. . . ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) retention , for retention capability .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he goes down the hallway , and you can see once that ' s called clear , straight trigger finger , in case there ' s any sympathetic muscle tightening , there ' s no problem .	O U-PER O O B-FAC L-FAC O O U-PER O O O U-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You ' ll see another person come right up here , and he ' ll hold on this door , because that ' s not been cleared space yet , again , straight trigger finger , but ready to shoot if he needs to .	U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-FAC O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O
Sort of ready but not quite ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .	O O O O O O O O O O
Absolutely .	O O
( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .	O O O O
Immediately making entry with the thing , and then pying ( ph ) the room out , getting angles of vision as they clear it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC L-FAC O O O O O O O U-PER O O O
But look at that , a dark space from a lighted space .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Who knows what ' s in the recesses ?	U-PER O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O
All right .	O O O
Let ' s roll that second tape quickly , and we ' ll show you a couple more tips from Kelly ' s perspective .	O O U-ORG O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O
So far , what we ' re seeing is pretty much textbook .	O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O
Absolutely .	O O
( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) . . .	O O O O O O
All right .	O O O
Now , this is a rural setting , but this could be applied to urban combat , yes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very different circumstance .	O O O O
Same thing when you come into a building .	O O O U-PER O O B-FAC L-FAC O
But stop the tape right here . . .	O O O O O O O O O
Oop , we missed it , we missed it . . .	O O U-ORG O O O U-ORG O O O O O
. . . if you would , ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) - - It ' s all right .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can see all this area . . .	U-PER O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O
No , just roll it .	O O O O O O
. . . out here .	O O O O O O
Just go ahead and roll it .	O O O O O O O
All of that has to be accounted for as well , not just the space in here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Your back is not covered .	U-PER O O O O O
Many angles you ' ve got to watch for .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O
Now , you see right here , he ' s got a sidearm , he ' s calling the team in .	O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O B-WEA L-WEA O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O
All the rear is - - Now , stop the tape .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .	O O O O O O
Imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here .	O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-FAC O
I mean , you could have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here . . .	U-PER O O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-WEA I-PER|L-WEA I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-FAC O O O
Up in this area here , here . . .	O O O O U-FAC O U-FAC O O O
. . . in any of these recesses back over here .	O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC L-FAC|U-FAC O
I mean , you know , you ' re looking at - - he wouldn ' t have a bomb ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) . . .	U-PER O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-WEA L-WEA O O O O O O
No , he wouldn ' t have that .	O O U-PER O O O O U-WEA O
But let me ask you this .	O O U-PER O U-PER O O
Also that the garb , ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) there ' s a cultural issue here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be , right ?	O O O O O O O U-WEA O O O O O O
Absolutely .	O O
And someones might say , Well , why put their hands on their head like this ?	O U-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O
Because , you know , you - - the hands hurt .	O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O
And I won ' t be able to determine what you ' re doing with your face .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O
Where are your hands and what do they hold ?	O O U-PER O O O O O O O
All right .	O O O
Let ' s roll it real quickly and we ' ll make a few more points , if we could .	O O U-ORG O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O
A lot of fear in their faces here .	O O O O O U-PER O O O
You see , by the way , they all have radios , I notice they have , like , a little headset there .	U-PER O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
That allows them to communicate ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) . . .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O
Immediate communications , absolutely .	O O O O O
You see them having their sectors of fire .	U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O O O
All these areas up in here , you know , could be subjected to people hiding , et cetera .	O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O
Now you ' ve got people coming down that have already been cleared .	O U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
Look at the fear on the faces .	O O O O O O O O
They don ' t understand what ' s going on .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
And you want to keep them calm , and . . .	O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O
Very calm , reassure them that this isn ' t about them .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O
Now , here ' s a little bit more aggressive stance .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exactly .	O O
Go ahead and stop tape . . .	O O O O O O O O
Stop it right there .	O O O O O
Oh , we missed it again .	O O U-ORG O O O O
. . . if you can .	O O O O U-PER O O
Obviously , that person is doing something that that soldier didn ' t appreciate .	O O B-PER L-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O
I would say aggressive is a good word for that . . .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
Absolutely .	O O
. . . the business end of that M - 16 .	O O O O O O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O
All right , Kelly McCann , thank you for some insights .	O O O B-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O O
And that - - compound that by a city of 5 million , it kind of boggles the mind and really gives you a sense of what lies head for U . S . and coalition forces .

It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
The remains of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard - board coffins .	B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O

The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken , and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O
It ' s not clear how long the bodies had lain here , but they were clearly not from this war .	O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O U-FAC O O U-PER O O O O O O O

It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside .	O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER L-PER O O
Inside a neighboring building , there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead .	O B-FAC I-FAC L-FAC O O O O O U-FAC O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O

Mr . Kubba , first of all , your thoughts as you ' ve watched these scenes of Baghdad , the Saddam Hussein regime falling in the last day ?	B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O B-ORG I-ORG|B-PER I-ORG|L-PER L-ORG O O O O O O
It is a huge sigh of relief , because it could have been much worse and Baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
And , obviously , there are four million people who could have suffered more .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
So , there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , obviously , there is a great , great concern about the scenes that you ' ve been showing on television .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O
Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq ?	O U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O
And , if you are , how concerned are they about the lawlessness ?	O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O
Well , not in the recent three or four days .	O O O O O O O O O O O
There are no phone lines to Baghdad .	O O O O O O U-GPE O

So those signs to me are worrying .	O O O O U-PER O O O
People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the more they test , the more I think they are claiming .	O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O
How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period , however long it is , where the U . S . is in charge ?	O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O
Well , one needs to break down this process into various elements .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
Today , there should be an authority .	O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O
And it ' s very likely that the U . S . and the British forces are the authority on land .	O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O
And there ought to be administration .	O O O O O O O
And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis .	O O O O O O O U-PER O
But when it comes to government , I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections .	O O O O O U-ORG O U-PER O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O
We need to involve the U . N . We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country , outside the country .	U-GPE O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O U-GPE O O O B-PER I-PER|U-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE L-PER|L-GPE O O B-GPE L-GPE O
But we need to do it quickly , because every day passes by with this vacuum , it ' s going to spell trouble .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , we know , Mr . Kubba , there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing for influence .	O O U-ORG O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O B-ORG I-ORG|B-PER|U-GPE I-ORG|L-PER L-ORG O O O O
Is one of them going to have an advantage ?	O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG|U-ORG O O O O O O
And , particularly , I have in mind the Iraqi National Congress that Mr . Chalabi , who was assisted by U . S . forces in getting back into Iraq ?

I think it ' s one thing to gain fame and access to Washington .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
It ' s totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq .	O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O
It must really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq .	O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC|U-GPE O
And there are 22 million people there .	O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER U-GPE O
It ' s not a void .	U-GPE O O O O O O
It ' s not a vacuum .	U-GPE O O O O O O
And I think all plans must be anchored there in Iraq in its reality .	O U-PER O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE|U-GPE O U-GPE O O
So does one group have an advantage over another now ?	O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O

Unfortunately , we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice .

Interview With Donald Rumsfeld ; Lugar , Dodd Talk About Post - War Iraq ; Kissinger , Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Welcome back to LATE EDITION .	O O O O O O
We return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .	U-ORG O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )	O O O O
I know during the war , before the war , you were very concerned about the position of the Syrian government , cooperating with Iraqis , having an open border , if you will .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O O U-PER O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O U-PER O O
Has the situation improved , especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state ' s meeting with Bashar al - Asad ?	O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-ORG O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
Well , I guess time will tell .	O O U-PER O O O O O
I talked to Secretary Powell this morning on the phone a bit , and it ' s not , I think you need to let the dust settle on that .	U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
He ' s , in my judgment , had a visit that was worth doing , and the president asked him to do it , and it was the right thing to do .	U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ' ll see what progress comes .	U-PER O O O O O O O
You know , words are one thing , actions are another .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
But right now you ' re open - minded as far as Syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism , take some of the other steps that you want them to take ?	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-GPE O O O
I know what they ' ve been doing , and it ' s been unhelpful .	U-PER O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
I know that Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful , and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future .	U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O U-GPE O O U-GPE O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O
In my view , they were making some unwise decisions previously .	O U-PER O O U-GPE O O O O O O O
What they ' ll do after this visit remains to be seen .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing , apparently , some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending , those detained at the U . S .	B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-ORG O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , about 600 or so of them .	O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC|U-GPE O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER|U-PER O
Is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals ?	O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
I don ' t think that ' s quite accurate as to what he wrote me about .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O
All right , tell me what . . .	O O O O U-PER O O O O
I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter - agency process , where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA and DIA , and what have you , involved in interrogating these detainees , it takes time to find out what intelligence they have .	U-PER O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O U-PER O B-PER|B-PER|B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|U-ORG I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|L-ORG I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|U-ORG I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|U-ORG I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER|L-PER|L-PER|U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate , and what Colin and I have been concerned about , both of us , is that it ' s taking so long .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O
There are a number of countries , and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries , that have foreign nationals in Gitmo , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , being detained , and those countries , understandably , would like to know when they could have those people . So the inter - agency process takes a great deal of time .	O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O U-GPE O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-LOC I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-LOC I-PER|I-LOC I-PER|I-LOC I-PER|L-LOC|U-GPE I-PER I-PER L-PER O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O
Colin and I are trying to speed up that process , and that ' s what that ' s all about .	U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let me just , a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O
Victory parades for the troops .	O O O B-PER L-PER O
I remember covering General Schwarzkopf , the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War .	U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O U-GPE O B-GPE L-GPE O O O U-LOC O O
Do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back , to have parades in New York , Washington , elsewhere ?	O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O U-GPE O U-GPE O
There ' s no question but that the troops , the young men and women , did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them , and there will be .	O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world , and indeed for the Iraqi people , who have been liberated .	O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O B-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O B-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
What ' s the best way to do that ?	O O O O O O O O O O
In the case of 1991 , the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait , and they did it , and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O U-GPE O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
In this instance , it was a very different task .	O O O O O O O O O O O
It was to remove that regime , and it ' s part of a global war on terrorism that is not over .	O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist , that work with those global networks .	U-GPE O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|U-PER L-ORG O B-GPE|U-PER I-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE|B-ORG I-GPE|I-ORG L-GPE|L-ORG O
And on the one hand we will , in fact , find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women , and we ' ll do it well .	O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O U-GPE O O O O O O
Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing , I don ' t know .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O
I kind of doubt it , because it ' s such a different circumstance .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Certainly , our war plan was not modeled off of 1991 .	O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O
One final question on North Korea .	O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O
If the North Koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions . . .	O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O U-GPE B-WEA L-WEA O O O O
. . . a preemptive strike , is that something that is out there ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' m not one who speculates about things like that .	U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
I know that back in the 1990s , in the Clinton administration , Secretary Perry called in the former secretaries of defense , and we had a discussion , and they clearly had teed up a military option that they were considering , and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate .	U-PER O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG|U-PER L-ORG O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O U-ORG O O U-ORG O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O
But those are very serious issues , and I leave them for the president .	O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O

Senators , welcome back to LATE EDITION .	U-PER O O O O O O O
Mr . Chairman , let me begin with you .	B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O U-PER O
Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that , when all the dust settles , the U . S . may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ?	O U-PER O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-WEA I-PER|I-WEA I-PER|I-WEA I-PER|L-WEA I-PER L-PER|U-GPE O
No , I concur with Secretary Powell , Secretary Rumsfeld , the president , that weapons of mass destruction are there , and likewise , that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are .	O O U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O U-GPE O O O O O U-GPE O O O O U-WEA O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-WEA L-PER O
What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and , likewise , the intellectual capital that is there to produce more .	O O U-GPE O O U-WEA O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-WEA O
Because not much else is - - you don ' t need much to get it going again .	O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
And that , I think , we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don ' t re - enter the business , much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn - Lugar program .	O O O U-PER O O U-GPE O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O U-PER O U-PER O O
What about you , Senator Dodd , do you believe , in the end , they will find weapons of mass destruction ?	O O U-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O
I have no evidence to the contrary .	U-PER O O O O O O O
And certainly , they have used them in the past .	O O O U-GPE O O U-WEA O O O O
There ' s no doubt about that at all , both in Iran and against the Kurdish population .	O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER L-PER O
So , whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case - - possibly some got out of the country .	O O O O O U-GPE O U-WEA O O O O O U-PER O O U-WEA O O O O O O O U-WEA O O O B-GPE L-GPE O
It wouldn ' t surprise me to hear that .	O O O O O U-PER O O O O
But I ' m going to work on the assumption , based on the intelligence that has been gathered , that the weapons of mass destruction existed .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O O
What if they don ' t ?	O O U-WEA O O O O
Well , you know , they ' ve used it in the past , and I think the point that Senator Lugar just made - - certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they ' ve used them in the past .	O O U-PER O O U-GPE O O O U-WEA O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O U-WEA O O O O
So , I wouldn ' t dwell on that point specifically , because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|B-WEA I-PER|I-PER|I-WEA I-PER|I-PER|I-WEA L-PER|L-PER|L-WEA O
He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity , and the world is a safer place today because he ' s not ruling Iraq .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O U-PER O O O O U-GPE O
Will the U . S . lose creditability , Mr . Chairman , if , if the U . S . finds no hard evidence , no so - called smoking gun ?	O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No , we have full credibility in Iraq .	O O U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O
We ' ve prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people , and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction , or at least to suppress evidence of them .	U-GPE O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O B-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O U-GPE O O O U-PER O O B-WEA I-WEA I-WEA L-WEA O O O O O O O O U-WEA O
That is a victory of sorts . This is a facet that ' s important .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It ' s important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and , likewise , the people involved , because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail .	O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O B-ORG L-ORG O B-PER L-PER O O O O
Senator Dodd , how important is it for the U . S . to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein ?	B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
Well , it ' s important .	O O O O O O O
But I don ' t think it ' s as important as finding Osama bin Laden , for the simple reason that I don ' t think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat , wherever he is .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O
If he is alive , obviously , he doesn ' t pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism .	O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O B-ORG|U-PER I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|B-LOC L-ORG|L-LOC O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O
So , it would certainly be good to know where he is .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
It would be , certainly , to know , to apprehend him , to bring him before a court of justice .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O
But I don ' t think it ' s absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O
And you agree with that assessment , Mr . Chairman ?	O U-PER O O O O O B-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
Yes , I think that Senator Dodd is right on .	O O U-PER O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O
Interview With Donald Rumsfeld ; Lugar , Dodd Talk About Post - War Iraq ; Kissinger , Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What about the length of the U . S . military presence in Iraq , Senator Lugar ?	O O O O O O B-ORG|B-GPE I-ORG|I-GPE I-ORG|L-GPE I-ORG L-ORG O O U-GPE O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O
How long do you anticipate large numbers of U . S . troops will remain there ?	O O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O O U-GPE O
Well , I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last interview , that we will have troops there as long as necessary , but no longer than necessary .	O O U-PER O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O U-PER U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that ' s a pretty good way to state it .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently .	U-PER O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O U-GPE O O O
We are trying to pass that on to others .	U-GPE O O O O O O O U-PER O
Likewise , the other government ' s procedures , the fledgling beginnings on democracy , and all the rest .	O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But that ' s going to require an undergirding .	O O O O O O O O O O
Now , in due course , as everybody points out , we may get help from other countries .	O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-GPE O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O
We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world .	U-GPE O O O B-GPE|U-ORG L-GPE O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-LOC I-PER|I-LOC|U-PER L-PER|L-LOC O
That would be helpful .	O O O O O
But for the moment , this is our responsibility .	O O O O O O O U-GPE O O
And we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out .	O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O
And I was upset , in a way , to hear reports that by the fall , three divisions out of five would be gone .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG|U-ORG O O O O
I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabused us of that today .	U-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O
And what about you , Senator Dodd , not only the length of time , but the cost to U . S . taxpayers ?	O O O U-PER O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|I-GPE I-PER|L-GPE I-PER L-PER O
Have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the United States ?	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O
Well , what we ' ve heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $ 100 billion .	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We put $ 2 . 5 billion in , in the last supplemental appropriations bill .	U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So it ' s going to be costly .	O O O O O O O O O

With opposition hardening , the White House left open the possibility Tuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on its war - making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat .	O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O

The United States still doesn ' t have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution , according to supporters and opponents , and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise .

The newspaper Babil , a popular daily owned by Saddam ' s son Odai , also said Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions , which are to be removed when the United Nations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them .

do you think the administration underestimated the day after ?	O U-PER O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O
i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think that there ' s been a pattern here not just with this administration , but over the last ten years , bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , where we don ' t quite recognize when the old order collapses , you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order .

but the key question , which i try to address in the book , is what do you do after that ?	O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition .	O O O O O U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O
and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?	O O O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O
there ' s no proof of that .	O O O O O O O O
well , the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O U-GPE O O O O O O O
but if you hold elections , you stop the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration .	O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' ve seen in the past in bosnia for example , you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy .	U-PER O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority , but the faster you get that , the more likely you stop this process .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE L-GPE O O O O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O
so what do you think of this interim government ?	O O O U-PER O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O

as a matter of fact , under this plan , some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut .	O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|L-ORG L-PER O O U-PER O O O
which leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a growing economy also needs small business investment .	O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O
and our tax code should encourage investment .	O U-GPE O O O O O O
today a small business can deduct a maximum of $ 25 , 000 in the year in which they buy equipment .	O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O
we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O
[ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit - - limit ought to be increased to $ 75 , 000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation .	O O O O U-PER O O U-ORG O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery .	O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O

more investment equals jobs .	O O O O O

[ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends .	O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
[ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair .	O O O O O O O O O O
it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .	O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O
the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends .	O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER O
falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income .	O O O O B-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O
it would encourage more investment in american businesses .	O O O O O O B-ORG|U-GPE L-ORG O
economists say that this plan will help our stock markets , and since half of american families own stock , the reform will help them save and help our economy grow .	U-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|U-GPE L-PER|L-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-GPE O O O

[ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create - - [ applause ] will create 1 . 4 million new jobs by the end of 2004 . in two years time , this nation has experienced war , a recession and a national emergency .

which has caused our government to run a deficit .	O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O
the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy , which means more revenues to our treasury , and less spending in washington , d . c . [ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint .

and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package .	O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O
we need at least $ 550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people , the more jobs we will create in this economy .	U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O

peterson disappeared on christmas eve of last year .	U-PER O O O O O O O O
paul vercammen joins me now from martinez , california , with the latest for us .	B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O B-GPE I-GPE L-GPE|U-GPE O O O O O U-PER O
reporter : well , lou , one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one , an adult female , and two , the remains of the almost full - term baby boy .	O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER|L-PER O
and of course , this is significant because laci peterson , when she disappeared from her modesto home , was 7 1 / 2 months pregnant .	O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O B-FAC|U-PER I-FAC|U-GPE L-FAC O O O O O O O O O
that was on christmas eve .	O O O O O O
her husband , scott , at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina .	B-PER|U-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O
now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone , and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-LOC I-PER|I-LOC L-PER|L-LOC O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this person came across the bone at the shore .	B-PER L-PER O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O
he brought it home and contacted the authorities , and we took possession of it .	U-PER O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O O O
and you ' re trying to connect it to the other - -	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
well , we ' re trying to find out if it ' s a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
reporter : and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link , there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER L-PER B-PER L-PER O O O O O
now this case is also taking on a rather , we should say , almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they ' re going to bring in an expert on what ' s called alufating decay , and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O
this is in the damage aspect of it .	O O O O O O O U-PER O
and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full - term baby boy were inside the female ' s remains at the time of death .	O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-LOC O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O O B-PER|B-PER I-PER|L-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O
also , the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons , for example , if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting .	O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O

paul , let me ask you , if i may , quickly , are we expecting - - is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these autopsies this afternoon ?	U-PER O O U-PER O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O
reporter : it sounds like all of this will be too quick , and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that ' s particularly important for the adult female remains .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|L-PER L-PER O
so now they ' re going to have to turn to dna , and that ' s why they ' re calling in these experts .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O

as we said , earlier this week , christine todd whitman stepped doup and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she ' s done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete .	O U-ORG O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from our new york bureau as i was introducing a moment ago , dan fagen , the environment writer for news day and dan , whitman did consider herself sort of the republican environmentalist .	O B-ORG|U-ORG I-ORG|B-GPE I-ORG|L-GPE L-ORG O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG L-PER|L-ORG O U-PER O U-PER O O U-PER O O B-PER I-PER|U-ORG L-PER O
but now there ' s been an awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she ' s teped down .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O
what do you suppose took place here ?	O O U-PER O O O O O
i think many people have watched thisstration in action and watched chis tee whitman in action .	U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O U-ORG O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O
the mystery is that she took the job in the first place or didn ' t leave earlier .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over .	U-PER O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O U-PER O O O O O O
she was not good at all at communicating the administration ' s message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy , the epa environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over .	U-PER O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O U-PER O O O O O O U-ORG O O B-PER I-PER|U-ORG I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O B-ORG L-ORG O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O
that ' s interesting because leading into it , while she was new jersey governor , she sued the epa and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the epa and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O B-PER|B-GPE I-PER|L-GPE L-PER O U-PER O B-ORG L-ORG O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG L-PER|L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let ' s hear what she had to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announcing her resignation .	O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O U-PER O O

i was never supportive of protocol because it didn ' t do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m leaving now because it ' s the appropriate time to do it .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dan , do you agree with that ?	U-PER O O U-PER O O O O
she says the appropriate time .	U-PER O O O O O
do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ?	O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O
i ' m sure that it was difficult for her personally , but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday she didn ' t see herself being undermined and overruledded .	U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O

let ' s talk a little bit more about what the navy does to prevent such tragedies .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O
we were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .	U-ORG O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O U-PER O
i ' ll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the " uss abraham lincoln " this is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention .	U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O U-VEH O B-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O
everybody that is , every sailor that ' s entersing the navy does take a swim test .	U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG L-PER|L-ORG O O O O O O
they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they ' re practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .	O O O O O U-PER O O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
they also wear float coats .	U-PER O O O O O
you can see them here .	U-PER O O O O O
the yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .	O O O O O O O O O O
everything is color coordinated .	O O O O O
you see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .	U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O
they also have a manual device so if the toggles don ' t work they can blow air into the inflation device .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O
they have dive goggles and they ' re able to find them .	U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O
it also has a strobe light and a whistle .	O O O O O O O O O O
also such location devices , some ship have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to find or locate , let the rescuer locate them .	O O O O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O
also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O
all throughout the ship , all around the ship .	O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O B-VEH L-VEH O
and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not on entire all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .	O O O O O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|B-VEH L-VEH|L-VEH O O O O O O B-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O O
now let ' s talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .	O O O U-PER O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O
you will hear a p . a .	U-PER O O O O O O O
announcement around the entire ship .	O O B-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O
there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .	O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O
a ship - wide search will happen f . they don ' t see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .	O U-VEH O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O O
also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .	O B-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O O O O O O O U-VEH O O O O
inside those helicopters rescue imswimmers .	O B-VEH L-VEH B-PER L-PER O
if indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .	O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .	O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O B-VEH L-VEH O O U-PER O O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O O O O O O
the search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .	B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O
why call it off ?	O O O O O
there ' s a number of reasons to look at .	O O O O O O O O O O O
depending on the water temperature , it ' s very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they ' ve exhausted all resources by that time .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
anyway , we ' ll continue to follow what ' s happening on the " uss nassau " as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .	O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O

the intifada , the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation , heralded the rise of the muslim fundamentalism .	O O O O O O U-GPE O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O U-PER O O
in what had been a mostly secular palestinian movement .	O O O O O O O U-GPE O O
the most popular of these groups hamas , an acronym for islamic resistance movement .	B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG|B-ORG L-ORG|L-ORG U-ORG O O O O U-PER O O O
in english it means zeal , its aim - - the destruction of israel .	O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O U-GPE O
hamas is an islamic movement .	U-ORG O O U-PER O O
at the very beginning , it was encouraged by israel because they thought it was a counter weight to palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .	O O O O O U-ORG O O O U-GPE O U-GPE O U-ORG O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who was influenced by the islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from israel , he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s .

slowly it became more and more politicized , and more and more extreme in its demands for an islamic state .	O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O B-GPE I-GPE|U-PER L-GPE O
the extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks .	O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
but hamas had already become an important part of palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the palestinian authority did not .

she seemed startled to see someone that looked so different .	U-PER O O O O U-PER U-PER O O O O

the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the red planet .	B-ORG L-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O U-LOC O O O U-VEH O U-VEH O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O
one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit .	O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O
it ' s an idea plagued with unsolved problems .	O O O O O O O O O O
the latest issue of " popular science magazine " takes a look at the challenges nasa is facing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O
joining us is the contributing editor .	O U-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER O
good to see you , jeff .	O O O U-PER O U-PER O
thank you .	O U-PER O
it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon .	O O O O O O O O U-PER O O B-LOC L-LOC O
so what ' s the difficulty in being able to go to mars ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O
it ' s unimaginably difficult and different .	O O O O O O O O
mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us .	U-LOC O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O
it ' s a nine - month trip .	O O O O O O O O O
then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .	O O U-PER O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' re talking about conditions where there ' s radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O
the communications conditions once you ' re on mars , just to talk to people on earth , there ' s a 20 minute delay in the conversation .	O O O O U-PER O O O U-LOC O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER|U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O
so the - - you know , the issues are so much larger than going to the moon .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O
and for now , it ' s 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER|U-LOC O O
but as you say , it ' s a much further travel .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
but let ' s talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there .	O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-LOC O
the dust , for one thing .	O O O O O O O
cataracts another .	O O O
let ' s talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive .	O O U-PER O O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|U-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|U-PER I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH L-VEH O
right .	O O
well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth .	O O O O O O B-VEH L-VEH O O O O O U-LOC O
you ' d have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space .	U-PER O O O O O U-VEH O O U-LOC O O O O U-PER O O O O U-VEH O U-LOC O
so that means we need a good shuttle that ' s going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft .	O O O U-PER O B-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|U-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|U-PER I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH I-VEH|B-VEH L-VEH|L-VEH O
then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth ' s orbit all the way to mars .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-VEH O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O U-LOC O
that ' s probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we haven ' t really developed yet , because we couldn ' t carry that much fuel , obviously .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O
liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O
the bigger issue is once we get there , we can ' t carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we ' re going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet .	O O O O O U-PER O U-LOC O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC|B-LOC L-LOC|L-LOC O
and think of it .	O O O O O
mars is carbon dioxide .	U-LOC O O O O
so we can ' t breathe there .	O U-PER O O O O U-LOC O
so we ' re going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself .	O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC U-LOC O
all of this is in the works now , but i think it ' s going to take quite a few years to develop it .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you talk about the cosmic radiation .	U-PER O O O O O O
then of course there is the zero g bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O
absolutely .	O O
there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronauts in mars .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-LOC O
during the time in mars .	O O O O U-LOC O
because when the body has - - when there is no dpravity as there is on mars , the body doesn ' t pick up the calcium in the bones , so it doesn ' t keep getting the bones stronger and stronger .	O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
so they will just lose it .	O U-PER O O O O O
they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 .	U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O

I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners , which this might very well be a precursor to : Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface - to - air missiles ( SAMs ) , referred to as Man - Portable Air Defense Systems ( MANPADS ) , pose to commercial airliners .

Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
Instead , a menu of options may be considered , including installing infrared ( IR ) countermeasures on aircraft ; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures ; improving airport and regional security ; and strengthening missile non - proliferation efforts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-VEH O O O O O O O O O O O U-FAC O O O O O O U-WEA O O O O O
Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground - based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement .

However , this option has a relatively high cost , between $ 1 million and $ 3 million per aircraft , and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-VEH O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training , altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat , and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks .	O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O
However , these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U . S . airliners flying to and from foreign airports .

Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress ( H . R .	O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O

While this legislation is still under consideration , Homeland Security appropriations designated $ 60 million in FY2004 and $ 61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology .

But for five and a half years , he noted , Annan " refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr . Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5 , 000 U .

Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown , since the ball clearly touched the turf , and that ' s where the momentum of the game changed .	U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think it was also at that point that the scoreboard began to reflect Auburn ' s last title hopes dying as the Oklahoma - Colorado score would have begun showing the beat - down that was occuring .	U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O U-ORG O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O

While it was entertaining , that ' s not why I ' m posting about it .	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O

With 4 : 41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11 , Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks .	O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
Coming from the other direction , Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline .	O O O O O O B-PER|B-PER|U-ORG I-PER|L-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O
Remarkably , Ferguson held on to the ball , despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit .	O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O

The Packers went on to lose the game , but that ' s not the story here .	B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was not one of the staged stiff - armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts .	O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O
This was a vicious , arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson ' s head off of his body .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O
The play was immediately flagged , and moments later it was announced that Darius had been ejected , much to the crowd ' s delight .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O
One sidenote here is that , despite their rabid fandom and the situation , not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field .	O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O B-FAC L-FAC O

WalMart : Conglomerating ?	O O O O

According to the usually reliable CNN / Money , the " Twin Deficits " will continue to grow .	O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Interesting terminology . . .	O O O O O
I believe they ' re referring to the budget deficit and . . . the capital surplus ?	U-PER O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When analyzing trade deficits , it ' s important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O B-GPE L-GPE O
So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers ( who control about 20 % of global GDP ) and everybody else ( excluding the non - consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global GDP ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER|U-GPE I-PER I-PER I-PER|U-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Which of those is - - probably - - going to be a more important number ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we ' re simply a better place for investment - - higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face .	O O U-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE|U-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O
And what about that other deficit ?	O O O O O O O
It , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds .	O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O
And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia .	O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG|U-GPE O
So , not to be a heretic , but 1 ) We ' re issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) Wouldn ' t you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non - US investors , rather than raising taxes in America ?	O O O O O O O O O O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O U-GPE O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER|U-GPE L-PER O O O O O O U-GPE O
It ' s a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal I ' d be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab .	O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-ORG|U-GPE I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O
The Twin Deficits are a reality , but they aren ' t exactly a terrifying one .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

What ' s notable in this debate , however , is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that " While North Carolina ' s excise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
Okay , okay - - since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that ' s technically accurate .	O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O B-GPE L-GPE O O O O O O O
But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and inasmuch as these penalties aren ' t assessed on a per - pack basis , they don ' t - - they ' re a lump - sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before .

Interestingly , the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost .

Maurice R . " Hank " Greenberg , who turns 80 in May , groomed two sons to be successors , but both have since left AIG .

Perhaps this is a good time for a quick refresher . . . .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The CEO works for the board . . . end lesson .	B-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O
I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders .	U-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER|U-PER L-PER O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER|B-PER I-PER|I-PER L-PER|L-PER O
It would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman but to be honest with you I don ' t really believe that .	O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O U-PER U-PER O O O O O O O
I know CEO / chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance .	U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O
However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Having a combined CEO / Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team .	O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O
This downside of having a combined CEO / chair is offset by ( 1 ) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and ( 2 ) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO when dealing with suppliers , potential merger partners , etc .	O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O
# 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry .	O O O O O O O O O O O
I do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a CEO / Chair before investing .	U-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER|B-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-ORG I-PER|I-ORG|B-PER I-PER|I-ORG|I-PER I-PER|I-ORG|I-PER L-PER|L-ORG|L-PER O O O

It turns out that investors can benefit by paying attention to this list as well .	O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
In a study published in the Journal of Business Finance & Accounting ( 2003 , 30 : 771 - 798 ) , Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return .

This study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced .	O O O O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O
To often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work For information may still be useful even after the information becomes public .	O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O
It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year ' s list .

That is true but not very revealing wouldn ' t you say ?	O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O
Evidence is mixed mostly because ( 1 ) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and ( 2 ) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together .
