The Arabic UD treebank is based on the
[Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/padt/) (PADT),
created at the Charles University in Prague.
The treebank consists of 7,664 sentences (282,384 tokens) and its domain is mainly newswire.
The annotation is licensed under the terms of
[CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)
and its original (non-UD) version can be downloaded from

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Arabic UD treebank is created through
conversion of PADT data. The conversion procedure has been designed by Dan Zeman.
The main coordinator of the original PADT project was Otakar Smrž.
